Practicing C, just an experiment to try to create a shell program in C.
You can run all bash commands you would expect to be able to run.

To build:
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/k0src/simple-c-shell.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd simple-c-shell`
3. Build the program `gcc -o simple-shell main.c`
4. Run the program `./simple-shell`
